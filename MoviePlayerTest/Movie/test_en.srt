1
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,146
What do Euclid,

2
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:12,746
twelve-year-old Einstein,

3
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:16,397
and American President James Garfield
have in common?

4
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:20,956
They all came up with elegant
proofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem,

5
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:23,206
the rule that says for a right triangle,

6
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:27,086
the square of one side plus
the square of the other side

7
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:30,086
is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.

8
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:34,717
In other words, a²+b²=c².

9
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:38,297
This statement is one of the most
fundamental rules of geometry,

10
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:40,536
and the basis for practical applications,

11
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:45,697
like constructing stable buildings
and triangulating GPS coordinates.

12
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:48,683
The theorem is named for Pythagoras,

13
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:52,758
a Greek philosopher and mathematician
in the 6th century B.C.,

14
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:56,157
but it was known more than a
thousand years earlier.

15
00:00:56,157 --> 00:01:02,186
A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C.
lists 15 sets of numbers

16
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:04,037
that satisfy the theorem.

17
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:07,558
Some historians speculate 
that Ancient Egyptian surveyors

18
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:13,698
used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5,
to make square corners.

19
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:18,180
The theory is that surveyors could stretch
a knotted rope with twelve equal segments

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,229
to form a triangle with sides of length
3, 4 and 5.

21
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:25,939
According to the converse
of the Pythagorean theorem,

22
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,480
that has to make a right triangle,

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,639
and, therefore, a square corner.

24
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:33,420
And the earliest known 
Indian mathematical texts

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,770
written between 800 and 600 B.C.

26
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,847
state that a rope stretched across
the diagonal of a square

27
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:44,728
produces a square twice as large
as the original one.

28
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:49,350
That relationship can be derived
from the Pythagorean theorem.

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,241
But how do we know 
that the theorem is true

30
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:54,851
for every right triangle 
on a flat surface,

31
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:58,611
not just the ones these mathematicians
and surveyors knew about?

32
00:01:58,611 --> 00:01:59,951
Because we can prove it.

33
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:02,896
Proofs use existing mathematical rules
and logic

34
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:07,419
to demonstrate that a theorem
must hold true all the time.

35
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:11,137
One classic proof often attributed
to Pythagoras himself

36
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:14,011
uses a strategy called 
proof by rearrangement.

37
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:19,650
Take four identical right triangles
with side lengths a and b

38
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,132
and hypotenuse length c.

39
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:26,174
Arrange them so that their hypotenuses
form a tilted square.

40
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:29,769
The area of that square is c².

41
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,192
Now rearrange the triangles
into two rectangles,

42
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:35,992
leaving smaller squares on either side.

43
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:40,512
The areas of those squares
are a² and b².

44
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,681
Here's the key.

45
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:44,893
The total area of 
the figure didn't change,

46
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:48,261
and the areas of the triangles
didn't change.

47
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:51,379
So the empty space in one, c²

48
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,437
must be equal to 
the empty space in the other,

49
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:58,329
a² + b².

50
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:01,923
Another proof comes from a fellow Greek
mathematician Euclid

51
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:05,153
and was also stumbled upon
almost 2,000 years later

52
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:07,344
by twelve-year-old Einstein.

53
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:10,838
This proof divides one right triangle
into two others

54
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:15,153
and uses the principle that if the
corresponding angles of two triangles

55
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,334
are the same,

56
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:19,063
the ratio of their sides
is the same, too.

57
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:21,157
So for these three similar triangles,

58
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:25,074
you can write these expressions
for their sides.

59
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:35,633
Next, rearrange the terms.

60
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,814
And finally, add the two equations
together and simplify to get

61
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:51,644
ab²+ac²=bc²,

62
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:57,744
or a²+b²=c².

63
00:03:57,744 --> 00:04:00,005
Here's one that uses tessellation,

64
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:03,856
a repeating geometric pattern
for a more visual proof.

65
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:05,605
Can you see how it works?

66
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:08,218
Pause the video if you'd like some time
to think about it.

67
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:11,505
Here's the answer.

68
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:13,975
The dark gray square is a²

69
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:16,576
and the light gray one is b².

70
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:19,495
The one outlined in blue is c².

71
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:23,756
Each blue outlined square
contains the pieces of exactly one dark

72
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:25,896
and one light gray square,

73
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:28,548
proving the Pythagorean theorem again.

74
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:30,877
And if you'd really like 
to convince yourself,

75
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:34,542
you could build a turntable
with three square boxes of equal depth

76
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,217
connected to each other 
around a right triangle.

77
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:40,837
If you fill the largest square with water
and spin the turntable,

78
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:45,536
the water from the large square
will perfectly fill the two smaller ones.

79
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:50,984
The Pythagorean theorem has more
than 350 proofs, and counting,

80
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:53,265
ranging from brilliant to obscure.

81
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:55,229
Can you add your own to the mix?
